# myblog

Summary:
I have created a blog using various web development technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL. The name of the blog is "Blogy" and it includes an admin dashboard that allows for the management of users, articles, comments, and categories. The dashboard includes functionality for adding, deleting, and updating the different elements of the blog. This project demonstrates my ability to work with a variety of technologies to create a functional and user-friendly web application.
